# Exercise 1 - Hello World

Ok, so you have probably seen a few tutorials showing you how to get the message Hello World to display somewhere. You are now going to see at least one more.

# Problem

> Write a program that prints the text "HELLO WORLD" to the console (stdout).

This is an easy task just to get you started on your quest for node mastery. It allows me to also demostrate the general format of each walthrough. Lets start by looking at the hints given to us by the program.

# Hints

> To make Node.js program, create a new file with a `.js` extension and start writing JavaScript! Execute your program by running it with the
`node` command. e.g.:

```sh
$ node program.js
```

So this first part tells you how to make a node script and then run it in node. So go ahead and make your file. I called mine helloworld.js

> You can write to the console in the same way as in the browser:

```js
console.log("text")
```
This here is basically giving us the answer. The console.log() function will take the object inside the brackets and print it out to the console. So in your file you can type `console.log("HELLO WORLD")`. Save it.

> When you are done, you must run:

```sh
$ {appname} verify program.js
```

So for your app you will type:

```sh
$ learnyounode verify helloworld.js
```

> to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.

# Recap

1.  Node programs are javascript files.
2.  You run your program using `$ node programmename.js`
3.  Your can write to the console the same as in the browser.
4.  `console.log()` prints the contents of the brackets to the console.
5.  You verify a program using `$ learnyounode verify programname.js`

That's all for this tutorial. '
