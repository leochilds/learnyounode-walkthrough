# Exercise 7 - HTTP Client

We are now moving into the area of HTTP which stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. The is the scheme that most websites use for deliver of data between a server and a client. Other schemes include https which is the secure version and mailto which is for sending emails. This exercise will be looking at the client.

# Problem

> Write a program that performs an HTTP GET request to a URL provided to you as the first command-line argument. Write the String contents of **each** "data" event from the response to a new line on the console (stdout).

So, some new material here. We need to be able to send requests using the http scheme. Lets look at the hints.

# Hints

> For this exercise you will need to use the `http` core module.

> Documentation on the `http` module can be found by pointing your browser here:
  {rootdir:/node_apidoc/http.html}

> The `http.get()` method is a shortcut for simple GET requests, use it to simplify your solution. The first argument to `http.get()` can be the URL you want to GET, provide a callback as the second argument.

> Unlike other callback functions, this one has the signature:

```js
function callback (response) { /* ... */ }
```

So, we require a different module. Nothing new there. We also can use a new method `get()` which takes 2 arguments, our url and a callback. And our callback function is slightly different. So we can hit the ground running with:

```js
var http = require('http')

http.get(process.argv[2], function (response) {
  doSomething;
})
```

Now we need to assign our event handlers to the response argument.

```js
var http = require('http')

http.get(process.argv[2], function (response) {
  response.on('data', console.log)
  response.on('error', console.error)
})
```

So you can see the `.on()` method in this case takes 2 arguments, the data/error and the function to perform. To make this a complete http get request we can add the correct encoding.

```js
var http = require('http')

http.get(process.argv[2], function (response) {
  response.setEncoding('utf8')
  response.on('data', console.log)
  response.on('error', console.error)
})
```

So by running your program using:

```cs
$ node program.js url
```

You can see the response to your request printed out in the command line. If the url points to an html document, you will get each line of the document printed out in the console. 

# Recap

1.  `http`: is the required module for http requests.
2.  `.get`: is one http method, which is used for making requests to a server.
3.  The `.get` callback function doesn't follow the same node format that we have previously seen. 
4.  `.on()`: assigns our event handlers.
5.  Its good practice to include the used encoding. You can't always get away with ommitting it like many people do in html documents.

That's all for this walkthrough.
